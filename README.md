Smart Energy Meter

Hello! Thank you for checking this out.

This project is actually the web interface of a smart energy meter that my group at school built for our semester project. The project was challenging but fun, and it was an insightful experience. 

This web app was built with ReactJS and Firebase was used to receive and update the app with real-time readings from our device.
It was my first time working with Firebase as the backend of my project and I must say I enjoyed it.

The charts are powered by https://apexcharts.com/, but you can go through the code to see how I tweaked them to get my desired output.

The responsiveness was taken care of using react-bootstrap https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap, and the icon is from FontAwesome https://fontawesome.com/
